## Next Steps

* agent logic: voting = sorting task? ("How does the frontpage currently look like and how SHOULD the frontpage look like?" -> voting = submit "proposition" for better sorting) [3]
* find out number of votes by unique users + distributions [1, 2]

    * How many unique users? 
    * How many votes total (per unit time)?
    * 90-9-1 rule applies? Zipf's law?


## Problems

* missing values are ambiguous for some of the ranks (first period: missing -> not sampled; from second period on: missing -> not ranked)
