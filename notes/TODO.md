# To Do

* check all conditions for fullstories
* calculate "sampletime gain": Did a story disappear and reappear (possible data/request error)?
* Does the "two local qualities" approach make sense? (average of localquality4 and localquality5) [one formula penalizes uncertainty, the other rewards it -> is that a good argument to take both?]
